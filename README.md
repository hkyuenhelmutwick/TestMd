# **Theoretical Astrophysics**

Advances in astrophysics come through the interplay of observational discoveries and theoretical interpretations. The Theoretical Astrophysics (TA) Division at the Center for Astrophysics conducts field-leading research through the synthesis of expertise in theoretical and computational modeling with empirical data from the Center for Astrophysics’ observational and experimental divisions.

$$\int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi}$$

This is the example $E=mc^2$ $\alpha$

$$\begin{aligned}
a &= b + c \\
  &= d + e + f
\end{aligned}$$

Here is Schrodinger equation

$$i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi(x,t)=\left[-\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m}\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial x^{2}}+V(x,t)\right]\Psi(x,t).$$

Time dependent Schrodinger equation

$$i\hbar{\frac{d}{d t}}|\Psi(t)\rangle=\hat{H}|\Psi(t)\rangle$$

$$\begin{equation}
E=mc^2 \tag{1.1}
\end{equation}$$

Equation (1.1) shows the famous mass-energy equivalence formula.

### **Time-dependent equation**

where $t$ is time, ${\displaystyle \vert \Psi (t)\rangle }$ is the state vector of the quantum system ($\Psi$ being the Greek letter psi), and ${\hat {H}}$ is an observable, the Hamiltonian operator.
